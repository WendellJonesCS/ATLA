                Iroh was a retired Fire Nation general, a former Crown Prince of the nation, a Grand Lotus of the Order
                of the White Lotus, a firebending master, and a wise mentor to his nephew Zuko. He was the elder son of
                Fire Lord Azulon and Ilah and the older brother of Ozai. Iroh's well-known ability to breathe fire and
                his claims of "slaying" the last dragon earned him the honorary title "The Dragon of the West"
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike many other individuals from the Fire Nation, particularly those within his own family, Iroh was a
                wise, easy-going, and spiritual man. He appreciated and admired the balance of the four elements, and
                even incorporated aspects of the other elements into his own firebending techniques. Iroh aided Avatar
                Aang and his companions on several occasions, and was consequently branded as a traitor. An extremely
                perceptive person, he journeyed to the Spirit World in search of his deceased son Lu Ten. His knowledge
                and respect for the four elements allowed him to provide advice to others; he assisted many close
                associates and friends.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the traumatic death of his son, Iroh saw Zuko as his own son rather than his nephew, and
                encouraged him to choose his own destiny, rather than a fate members of the royal family expected of
                him. Upon Zuko's coronation as Fire Lord after Ozai's defeat and the conflict's conclusion, he reopened
                the Jasmine Dragon tea shop, and served tea for the rest of his retirement. When he deemed his business
                in the mortal world finished, Iroh chose to leave his body behind and travel to the Spirit World, where
                he continued serving tea to various spirits.
